
This has nothing to do with the gba, just fiddling around with QEMU

run with

qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 128M -nographic -kernel hello_world.bin

but I dont know how to get out of the console

if you do this:

qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 128M -kernel hello_world.bin

and then ctrl-alt-3  (not F3 but 3) will switch to the serial console
and you can see the output, and can close out of qemu.
