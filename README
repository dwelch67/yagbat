YAGBAT - Yet Another GBA Tutorial

Commercial GBA games basically run from a rom in the cartridge.  A
percentage of the games can be run using the link cable which downloads
enough of the game from the master into the ram of a slave and runs
from there.  Over the years there have been many similar and different
cartridge solutions for homebrew GBA development, and this tutorial will
definitely get to that topic.  For now though better to focus on running
from ram.

Actually, first focus on running in a simulator.  Visualboyadvance for
example is a pretty good GBA simulator that will work fine to get us
started.  After some basics, then move into multiboot cables and
flash/rom based solutions, etc.

Start with the hello_world example.
